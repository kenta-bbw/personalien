# Personalien

The "personalien" project is a Java-based project that prompts the user to input their personal information such as name, age, address, and phone number. 
The user's input is then stored in variables and displayed back to the user through the console. 
This project is a simple yet effective way to demonstrate how to capture and display user input using Java programming.
